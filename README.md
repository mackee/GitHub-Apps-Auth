# SYNOPSIS

    use GitHub::Apps::Auth;
    my $auth = GitHub::Apps::Auth->new(
        private_key     => "<filename>", # when read private key from file
        private_key     => \$pk,         # when read private key from variable
        app_id          => <app_id>,
        installation_id => <installation_id>
    );
    # This method returns the cached token inside an object.
    # However, refresh expired token automatically.
    my $token  = $auth->issued_token;

    use Pithub;
    # GitHub::Apps::Auth object behaves like a string.
    # This object calls the `issued_token` method
    # each time it evaluates as a string.
    my $ph = Pithub->new(token => $auth, ...);

#### private\_key

**Required: true**

This parameter is a private key of the GitHub Apps.

This must be a filename or string in the pem format. You can get a private key from Settings page of GitHub Apps. See [Generating a private key](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#generating-a-private-key).

# METHODS

## issued\_token

    my $token  = $auth->issued_token;

`issued_token` returns a API token in string.This token is cached while valid. When calling this method with condition that expired token, this method refreshes a token automatically.

## token

This method returns an API token. Unlike C &lt;issued\_token>, this method not refresh an expired token.

## expires

This returns the token expiration date in the epoch.

# OPERATOR OVERLOADS

`GitHub::Apps::Auth` is overloaded so that \`issued\_token\` is called when evaluated as a string. So probably be usable in GitHub client that use raw string API token. Ex [Pithub](https://metacpan.org/pod/Pithub).
